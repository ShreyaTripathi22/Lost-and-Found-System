# 🧭 Lost & Found Tracking System

A modern, full-stack web application designed to help users report, browse, and recover lost and found items through a smart, crowdsourced platform. Built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, the system allows users to post reports, view items, and get notified when similar items are matched—streamlining the entire recovery process.
